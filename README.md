## Laptop Price Prediction Project

This project predicts laptop prices based on their specifications. It offers a modular and reusable package for future development. Additionally, a web application allows users to easily interact with the model.

**Project Structure**

The project follows a modular approach, divided into distinct stages:

1. **Data Preparation:**
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    * Data Cleaning
    * Data Transformation

2. **Model Development:**
    * Model selection, training, and evaluation
    
3. **Web Application:**
    * Flask backend for handling user input and model prediction
    * HTML and CSS for user interface

**Technologies Used:**

* Programming Languages: Python
* Frameworks: Flask
* Libraries: (List any specific libraries used for data manipulation, modeling, etc.)
* Cloud Platform: AWS
* Version Control: Git
* CI/CD: AWS CodePipeline

**Deployment**

The project is deployed on the AWS cloud and utilizes AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). This ensures automated build, testing, and deployment whenever changes are made to the codebase.
